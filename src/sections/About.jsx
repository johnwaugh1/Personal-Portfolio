        A Computer Science student at Appalachian State University, currently working as
        an Embedded Systems Engineer and Race Operations Lead at Team Sunergy, where I help design, build, and race solar-powered cars. My responsibilities include enhancing telemetry systems, managing team operations, and handling fundraising and sponsorship efforts.
        In addition, I serve as the Composites Specialist, designing and fabricating lightweight, structurally strong components using advanced composite materials like fiberglass and carbon fiber.
        I've completed coursework in Data Structures, Software Engineering, Computer Systems, and Data Analysis, and have strengthened my skills with online courses in AI/ML and web development.
        I'm actively seeking an internship in AI/ML, web development, embedded systems, or full-stack development, where I can contribute to impactful projects and further develop my expertise.
